The image above represents the main function.
You can see, in the red rectangle, the instruction "push    offset Name     ; "rc.rc"". The function "FindResourceA" will take as a parameter
the Name and will return a handle to the specified resource. In the blue rectangle, the uID for the "LoadStringA" is calculated. Basically,
the uID is just the number of the string to be retrived form the resources section of the PE file. After we make the math, the uID is 272 (256 OR 16)

Then, we open the "strings3.exe_" in Resource Hacker, and we search for the number 272 string. That is the flag.
